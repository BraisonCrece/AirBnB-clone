# Airbnb clone
Being able to see a professional web developer at work (without video cuts) is a very enriching process.
I am following [TypeFast project on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCawOXF4xaJK1_-KVgXyREULRVy_W_1pe), taking notes on everything that is new to me, and learning about the actual flow of development:
- Have a problem --> Identify the source of the problem --> Know how to find information about the problem --> process the problem --> solve the problem.

I will use:
* Ruby on Rails --> 7.0.4
* Ruby --> 3.1.2p20
* TailWind + TailWindUI
* StimulusJS
* Turbo

How to:
1. clone repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/BraisonCrece/Airbnb-clone`
2. inside de cloned directory open a terminal and run:

    `bundle install`
3. run the development server:

    `bin/dev`
4. open a browser and go to this url:

    [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
