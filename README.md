Being able to see a professional web developer at work (without video cuts) is a very enriching process.
I am following [TypeFast project on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCawOXF4xaJK1_-KVgXyREULRVy_W_1pe), taking notes on everything that is new to me, and learning about the actual flow of development:
- Have a problem --> Identify the source of the problem --> Know how to find information about the problem --> process the problem --> solve the problem.

I will use:
* Ruby on Rails --> 7
* Ruby --> 3
* TailWind + TailWindUI
* StimulusJS
* Turbo
